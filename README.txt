Hindi Compiler Project

Brief Description
This project implements a compiler for a subset of the Hindi programming language. The compiler converts Hindi code into three-address code (TAC), then translates it into C code, and finally compiles and executes it. The compiler supports basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and print statements.

Special Instructions to Run the Code

1. Prerequisites:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system
   - GCC compiler installed for C code compilation and execution

2. Running the Compiler:
   - Save the provided Python code in a file named `hindi_compiler.py`
   - Create a separate file with your Hindi code (e.g., `program.hi`)
   - Run the compiler using the following command:
     ```
     python hindi_compiler.py
     ```

3. Sample Usage:
   - The compiler will generate C code from the Hindi code and attempt to compile and run it
   - Output will be displayed in the console

4. Notes:
   - The compiler currently supports basic syntax and may not handle all edge cases
   - Ensure your system has the necessary dependencies installed for GCC compilation
